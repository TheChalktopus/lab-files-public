Run power from 5V
Power switch off of same power from box.
Run forward bias diode from Relay "DC+" to + side of the all the switches. Run other side of all the diodes to the + side of the isolating bnc port. Run the ground side of the isolating bnc to DC- on the relay. Run reverse bias diode from ground of isolating bnc to other side of isolating bnc.

Solder small wires from isolating bnc on switch mount to switch in mount.

Solder non-isolating BNCs ground together. Run wire from there to XM on relay.

Circuit Stuff
1. [ ] Cut wire
   1. [ ] 4 short wire to connect + side of all the switches
   2. [ ] 4 long green wire to connect ground of all switches (off of isolating bnc)
   3. [ ] 4 long red wire for nonisolating bnc
   4. [ ] 4 long green wire for nonisolating bnc
   5. [ ] 4 short green wire to connect ground of all relay channels
2. [ ] Solder BNC panel mounts
3. [ ] Solder wire together
   1. [ ] solder 4 green wires from nonisolating BNC together to connect ground of all the switches.
   2. [ ] solder
4. [ ] Diodes
   1. [ ] Solder reverse bias diode from switch output to isolating BNC ground for each switch.
   2. [ ] Add forward bias diode from banana connector to DC+
