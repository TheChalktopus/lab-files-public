Run power from 5V
Power switch off of same power from box.
Run forward bias diode from Relay "DC+" to + side of the all the switches. Run other side of all the diodes to the + side of the isolating bnc port. Run the ground side of the isolating bnc to DC- on the relay. Run reverse bias diode from ground of isolating bnc to other side of isolating bnc.

Solder small wires from isolating bnc on switch mount to switch in mount.

Solder non-isolating BNCs ground together. Run wire from there to XM on relay.

1. [ ]Cut short wire to connect + side of all the switches
2. [ ]solder 4 wires together to connect ground of all the switches
3. [ ] 
4. [ ]solder all the non-isolating bncs
5. [ ] solder all the isolating bncs for the box
6. [ ]solder the reverse bias diodes to the isolating bncs for the box
7. [ ]solder all the isolating bncs for the switches
8. [ ]solder all the isolating bncs to the switches
